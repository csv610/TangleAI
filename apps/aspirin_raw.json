It acetylates a serine residue in the active site of COX-1, leading to permanent inactivation of the enzyme in platelets. This inhibits the production of thromboxane A2 (TXA2), a potent platelet aggregator and vasoconstrictor, thereby exerting an antiplatelet effect that lasts for the lifespan of the platelet (7–10 days). Inhibition of COX-2 reduces the synthesis of pro-inflammatory prostaglandins, contributing to its anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic effects. Aspirin also modifies COX-2 activity to produce anti-inflammatory epi-lipoxins. Salicylic acid, the primary metabolite of aspirin, also has anti-inflammatory, antipyretic, and analgesic properties and may activate AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK).", "pharmacodynamics": "Aspirin reduces platelet aggregation, decreases prostaglandin-mediated pain and inflammation, and lowers body temperature by acting on the hypothalamic heat-regulating center.
